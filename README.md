# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

## Overview
This project involves scraping data from two Mars-related websites:
1. Mars News: Scraping news article titles and preview text.
2. Mars Weather: Scraping weather data of the Curiosity rover on Mars.

## Steps:
1. **Scraping Mars News**: Used Splinter and BeautifulSoup to extract titles and preview text of news articles and stored the data in JSON format.
2. **Scraping Mars Weather**: Extracted weather data, including minimum temperature and atmospheric pressure, from a table and saved the data in CSV format.
3. **Analysis**: Conducted various analyses on the weather data, such as identifying the coldest/warmest months, lowest/highest pressure months, and estimating the number of Earth days in a Martian year.

## Files:
- `mars_news.json`: Contains the scraped Mars news titles and previews.
- `mars_weather_data.csv`: Contains the scraped Mars weather data with various columns like temperature, pressure, and sol.

## Results:
- Analyzed the Martian months, temperature trends, and atmospheric pressure to gain insights about the Martian environment.
